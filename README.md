# Stacks-n-Queues

/

Stacks and Queues are two data structures that access and handle data in similar, but distinctly different ways. Queues operate on FIFO ("first in, first out"), itmes are removed from first to last. Queues use the enqueue (last priority) and dequeue (top priority) method. Computer processing unit (CPU) scheduling is also based on a queue. Tasks are executed in the order in which they were called, while the execution of tasks further down in the queue is put on hold until resources are available.
